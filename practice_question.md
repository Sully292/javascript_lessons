Function practice questions

Q1 write a function which takes a number and prints its square hint : square is num*num
for example  2*2 = 4 so  4 is square of 2


Q2 write a function which takes three numbers as parameters and tell which one is smallests
    function should not print that a is smallest , it should print the exact number  like 8 is smallest
     hint : use your code "a,b,c which one is smaller.js" 
     hint : to call your function       you will do  myfunc(55,85,8)
